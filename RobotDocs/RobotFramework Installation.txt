Robot Framework Installation 

This document details the steps required to get a Robot Framework environment configured. 

Python Installation - Windows
Download and install python 2.7 
NOTE: You must not install Python 3.0 as the Selenium2Library (a key part of Robot Framework) is not fully compatible with Python 3.0. It is expected to be compatible in the upcoming months. 

1.	Download: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.12/python-2.7.12.amd64.msi 
2.	Run the downloaded .msi file
3.	If given the option, make sure to install Python for all users 
Note: The remainder of the instructions assume you installed python in the default location 

Add Python to the system path 
1.	Windows Menu -> Right click on Computer -> Properties - > Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables 
2.	Under System Variables, click on "Path" and then "Edit". (Or if not already present, click "New"

We can use any of the standard ones just with an additional library call in the test suite.  External libraries require installation, but not that big a deal.
